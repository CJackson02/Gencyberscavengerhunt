# GenCyber OSINT Scavenger Hunt 🔍

Welcome to the **GenCyber OSINT Scavenger Hunt** — an immersive digital challenge crafted for students to sharpen their open-source intelligence skills through interactive investigation, technical clues, and puzzle-solving.

## 🧩 About the Project

Participants will step into the shoes of cyber analysts tracking digital trails across metadata, public files, and online tools. The hunt includes:

- Real-world research tasks and metadata puzzles
- Decrypting filetypes and URLs
- Using EXIF data, domain records, and open directories
- Riddle-based challenges that subtly connect to technical vocabulary

Each task uncovers fragments of a fictional investigation, helping students build narrative logic and apply cybersecurity concepts hands-on.

Some steps even nod to real-world threat takedowns — a subtle reference to a recent cyber operation that was truly an _endgame_ for a major malware botnet.
